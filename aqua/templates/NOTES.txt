It may take a few minutes for the Aqua Console UI to become available. You can watch its status by running:

  kubectl get svc -w {{ template "fullname" . }}-web

Once the console is available you can get the address of the Aqua Console UI with the following commands:

   kubectl get svc {{ template "fullname" . }}-web

You will need to install the Aqua Agent daemonset on your cluster. We recommend using the "Batch install" process available in the UI under the "Hosts" tab.
